When using <> (angle brackets), the compiler looks for the header file in the system's include path. This is where the standard library headers are located. For example, #include <iostream> tells the compiler to look for the header file iostream in the system's include path.

When using "" (double quotes), the compiler looks for the header file in the same directory as the source file or in the directories specified by the -I flag passed to the compiler. For example, #include "myheader.h" tells the compiler to look for the header file myheader.h in the same directory as the source file or in the directories specified by the -I flag.
